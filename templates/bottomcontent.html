                  From wireframes to user narratives, to front end styling and finally to back end authentication and server requests, I created a social media app that builds authentic community by connecting users, sharing resources and revolutionazing fundraising. I used over 10 different frameworks, languages and libraries to create this project.Before I started this project, I had little to no experience using these technologies. I used over 10 different frameworks and languages to compelete this project which I learned within a span of 3 weeks. I am especially proud of the mapbox functionality. I was able to display a static map that takes in addresses and geocodes their locations to show a new marker on the page everytime a new project is added. I am also proud of the referenced model I created that allows projects to be assigned to users. This was also my first time working with authentication / authorization. The process was challenging but I managed to figure it out and was able to have a sleek modal sign-up, and login page that creates users and manages their sessions.

                  Cinescape was developed on AngularJS and a Node backend. For this project, I managed all areas of development from inception to final product presentation. Particular
                  stumbling blocks, I am proud to have overcome is parsing XML to JSON to return data from an external API and being able to integrate multiple external APIs using front and back end technologies

                  This web application was collaboratively by 4 developers. 
                  This project was developed using Ruby on Rails. I was responsible for the  mailer functionality, authentication, authorization, styling, overall concept, and mapbox functionality. I am especially proud of implementing the mailer for this project. I was solely responsible for using SendGrid to incorporate an email confirmation that would be sent to users once they sign up. I was also very proud of the dynamic map icons I integrated into our static map.

                  Vagabond is a collaborative project. I was responsible for managing the backend including server calls to the database. I was responsible for front end styling and mapbox functionality. I am especially proud of the seamless routing and authorization I built on the back end for this project. I did not have a lot of experience with the rails backend when I started this project. I learned a lot from being the backend manager on this project.

                  This is an app I created during the first few weeks of the program where using vanilla javascript, underscore, and AJAX, I had to query the spotify api to return requests based on song title. This was an independent assignment which was quite challenging. This was my first time working with an API to return very specific data that I would need to render on the page using underscore templating.
